Learning rails

Hi folks!

I decided to make an entry into web design and after reviewing many many combinations of languages and frameworks I eventually settled on Ruby on Rails. 
The community is absolutely astounding and welcoming. The more I get into it, the more convinced I am that I made the right choice.
